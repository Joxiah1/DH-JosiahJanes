### Description of Project
In this project, I will be revising my previous wireflow draft and digitizing it. Specifically, I will be simulating the proposed Nevada DMV app solution on Figma and digitizing the wireframes and flow in terms of an iPhone 8 screen. Afterward, I will test various graphic design layouts and variations to make the prototype more enjoyable and easy to use for the end user. This will also be done using Figma while using various plugins and other sources to verify that the prototype satisfies certain color contrast ratio and spacing requirements.

### Description of Design Process
My previous research on the intended userbase of the Nevada DMV website and potential smartphone app users showed that users want a simple, trustworthy, and official aesthetic and feel for the website/app. This makes sense, as users of sites like Nevada's DMV website often are overwhelmed by the breadth of information that such sites offer as well as potential scams that could be used to phish personal information from users. As a previous user described, users also do not want a site or app that looks "cheap".

With all of this in mind, the goal with this project's graphic design was to mimic the look and feel of other apps and websites that users regard as being simple and trustworthy. In accordance with this, I looked to websites and apps like Coinbase that are very good at being simple while conveying a sense of trustworthiness and functionality. While mimicking some of their own design choices in my own project, I also tested various other fonts, spacings, colors, etc. that could have worked with the site. I tested casual feeling designs, formal designs, etc., but I ended up sticking with a rather basic layout that I would expect out of a common app that users would find on the app store. While I believe that the app's current layout is sufficient in its simplicity, I believe it suffers from being easily copied from a malicious body that may seek to imitate the site to scam users. It was only after observing volunteer users of this app prototype and the official DMV website that I realized how important this is, and I will look further into how I can make my app both simple, yet hard to imitate. I will also show my current design to users to get their own feedback on what they feel and what I can change.

### Impression Test
#### Video Recording
A video recording of the impression test I conducted can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1LlgBZ9w89pABQlWjENAm2zJ6wTu0aiBz/view?usp=sharing).

#### Summary of Findings
It seems that the overall design of the hypothetical Nevada DMV app is a success. The user found the site to be "clean, simple, and visually pleasing". They also appreciated how "snappy" the site felt as well as how it benefitted from not being cluttered with information. However, the user did note that the app could be slightly improved by adding a search bar, but overall, it seems that the app's design is sufficiently user friendly in its current form and succeeds in not alienating users that may normally feel intimidated by a site like Nevada's official DMV website.
