### Description of Project
In this project, I will be revising my previous wireflow draft and digitizing it. Specifically, I will be simulating the proposed Nevada DMV app solution on Figma and digitizing the wireframes and flow in terms of an iPhone 8 screen. Afterward, I will test various graphic design layouts and variations to make the prototype more enjoyable and easy to use for the end user. This will also be done using Figma while using various plugins and other sources to verify that the prototype satisfies certain color contrast ratio and spacing requirements.
