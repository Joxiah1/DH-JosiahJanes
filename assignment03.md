### Specify the Research Goal & Requirements
**What is the main activity your project would support for the users?**
>My project would help to identify the common problems that users encounter when finding information about purchasing and registering a vehicle. By understanding the difficulties involved in doing so, we can further empower citizens to feel comfortable about purchasing and registering their own vehicles.

**What is the basic need/goal involved for that activity?**
>The basic need that is required for this activity is the observation of the user's behavior and needs throughout this process of research. We would also observe more about what the user needs to do this research on their own as well.

**What is(are) the traditional/current solution(s) to satisfy the needs?**
>The traditional solutions to this method involve using online search engines and acquaintances to obtain information about the process involved in registering a vehicle with the DMV.

**What is(are) the limitation(s) that possible would be improved with (digital) technology?**
>Digital technology can help to centralize the information that is needed for vehicle registration in one place that is easy for users to reach. Without the use of digital technology, users are forced to travel to a location like the DMV in person to obtain this information. If we can make this information easily available online and tailor it to the needs of the user, we can alleviate the stress of registering a vehicle while decreasing the workload of DMV employees.

### Target Users

**What are the characteristics of users? (ex. demographics, preference, expertise)**
>Demographic: 18-30 year olds
>Preferences: Prefer to find their information online as opposed to using traditional methods of word-of-mouth, impatient when it comes to finding information
>Expertise: Proficient in using digital technology, high digital literacy

**In which context (where, why) would the users do that activity?**
>Users would likely choose to register their vehicle shortly after purchasing or using their first car. It is hypothesized that participants would do this process at home.

**What do/did the users usually do in order to complete that activity?**
>The target user usually uses Google or YouTube for demonstrations on how to complete this activity. Users would then need to navigate to the DMV from that point to fill out the proper paperwork and understand the process involved in registering their vehicle.

### Qualitative Research Method
The research will be conducted by asking the participant various questions about registering a vehicle and how they believe it would be done. Then the participant will be asked to go through the vehicle registration process themselves to see how it is done. After they feel that they have obtained this information, we will reconvene to discuss the strengths and weaknesses of this current method of research and registration. Then we will conclude by asking the participant how digital technology can be better used to fulfill their needs while completing this activity.
