### Specify the Research Goal & Requirements
**What is the main activity your project would support for the users?**
>My project would help to identify the common problems that users encounter when finding information about purchasing and registering a vehicle. By understanding the difficulties involved in doing so, we can further empower citizens to feel comfortable about purchasing and registering their own vehicles.

**What is the basic need/goal involved for that activity?**
>The basic need that is required for this activity is the observation of the user's behavior and needs throughout this process of research. We would also observe more about what the user needs to do this research on their own as well.

**What is(are) the traditional/current solution(s) to satisfy the needs?**
>The traditional solutions to this method involve using online search engines and acquaintances to obtain information about the process involved in registering a vehicle with the DMV.

**What is(are) the limitation(s) that possible would be improved with (digital) technology?**
>Digital technology can help to centralize the information that is needed for vehicle registration in one place that is easy for users to reach. Without the use of digital technology, users are forced to travel to a location like the DMV in person to obtain this information. If we can make this information easily available online and tailor it to the needs of the user, we can alleviate the stress of registering a vehicle while decreasing the workload of DMV employees.

### Target Users

**What are the characteristics of users? (ex. demographics, preference, expertise)**
>Demographic: 18-30 year olds
>Preferences: Prefer to find their information online as opposed to using traditional methods of word-of-mouth, impatient when it comes to finding information
>Expertise: Proficient in using digital technology, high digital literacy

**In which context (where, why) would the users do that activity?**
>Users would likely choose to register their vehicle shortly after purchasing or using their first car. It is hypothesized that participants would do this process at home.

**What do/did the users usually do in order to complete that activity?**
>The target user usually uses Google or YouTube for demonstrations on how to complete this activity. Users would then need to navigate to the DMV from that point to fill out the proper paperwork and understand the process involved in registering their vehicle.

### Qualitative Research Method
The research will be conducted by asking the participant various questions about registering a vehicle and how they believe it would be done. Then the participant will be asked to go through the vehicle registration process themselves to see how it is done. After they feel that they have obtained this information, we will reconvene to discuss the strengths and weaknesses of this current method of research and registration. Then we will conclude by asking the participant to navigate to Nevada's official DMV website to ask how the website can be improved to more easily allow for this process to be completed.

### Reflection
It shall first be noted that my participant was a prime example of our target userbase. Since most adults presumably know how to register their vehicles, our target demographic was predicted to be young people that would need to register their vehicle after purchasing it. Luckily, my participant fell perfectly into this category. My participant is a college-aged, technologically literate male that has never owned a car before. Therefore, they have never gone about this process, and evaluating them provided valuable information about how our target demographic thinks and behaves when tasked with registering their vehicle.

When tasked with the hypothetical scenario of having to register a newly purchased vehicle, my participant quickly navigated to Google to search "colorado vehicle registration". This search provides observors with several valuable pieces of information. Firstly, it shall be noted that my participant is based in Colorado, so he included the name of his state in the search. This communicates that users of this type understand that there are different rules and regulations for vehicle registration across states. Second, despite the fact that my participant initially stated that they would likely visit an official DMV website or location to obtain information about registering a vehicle, they instead searched directly for "vehicle registration" as opposed to Colorado DMV. This is especially interesting because this search shows that our target demographic chooses to directly search for the information they are trying to obtain as opposed to the location where that information may normally be stored. Interestingly, this search ultimately took them to the Colorado DMV website and then they found the information from there.

The top search result immediately took the participant to the Colorado DMV website's vehicle registration section. Despite the registration section being clearly labelled "Registration", my participant still felt hesitant to click the links that were there, and decided to check the other links to make sure they were going to click the right one. This makes some sense, as there was an additional section for "Registration for Other Vehicles" below it, which likely confused the participant. They chose to click the "County Motor Vehicle Offices" link to see the nearest DMV location to them. They eventually backtracked to the original registration section directory and clicked "Registration Requirements". They read through these requirements, then eventually chose to click the "Vehicle Services" section of the site and then clicked "Online Registration Renewal" and was finally taken to a form fillout section to renew their vehicle's registration. At this point, the participant finally felt like they completed the task.

Several important findings can be observed from this task. First, it shall be noted that the user associated Google's top search results with validity and immediately trusted that the first result was the actual Colorado DMV website. Second, the participant was greatly confused by the site's multiple sections for vehicle registration. They finally felt like they completed the task when they reached an online form that would guide them through the process of reggistering their vehicle. With all of this in mind, websites like this ought to simplify their vehicle registration sections. There should also be a clearly distinctive link in this section that should take users to an online form that they can fill out to complete this task and input the required information. This seems to be the best way to streamline the registration process while making users feel satisfied and confident that they complete this task. The participant noted that the site's main weakness was that things were disorganized and that it took them a bit longer than expected to confidently complete this task and obtain this information.

Finally, the participant was asked to navigate to the Nevada DMV website for comparison and evaluation. Upon being tasked with vehicle registration on this site, they immediately found the site's upper navigation tab link entitled "Registration", clicked it, and clicked the "Online Renewal" dropdown tab. This took them to an online form for them to input their information, and they felt satisfied with the site's current layout. They noted that the site was very "straight forward" and that they specifically preferred the site's layout and menu's over the Colorado site. 

Ultimately, it seems that users feel that they have reached the right place when they eventually reach a page that requires them to input their vehicle information to reggister their vehicle. Sites of this nature also ought to streamline their site's layout to quickly navigate to links of this nature so as to prevent user frustration and to make them feel confident in completing their task. Overall, it seems that our target demographic values web pages that are simple, streamlined, guiding, and official in the way that they present and ask the user for information regarding vehicle registration.

In reflection on my own interview of the participant, I wish I asked how the Nevada DMV site vehicle registration section could have been improved, but it seems that it is in a decent spot right now. The participant chose to often respond in very short, one word responses throughout the interview, and I should have asked them, politely, to flesh out their ideas a bit more and to speak in complete sentences to more accurately observe and understand the way they interact with and understand the sites they interact with. Overall, I think the research was a success and I have learned a lot about what users value and look for in a site of this type.
