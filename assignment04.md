### The Purpose of UX Storytelling

In this project, we will be using UX storytelling to further understand who our user is, how they think, and how our product can be better designed with our intended users in mind. UX storytelling is the process of analyzing a scenario in which a hypothetical user interacts with our product. In our case, we will be examining the approximated identities of our intended userbase and will design a mobile phone app solution to many problems that they commonly face while interacting with Nevada's official DMV website.
