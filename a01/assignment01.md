# Assignment 01: Evaluation of Usability Heuristics on Nevada's Official Government Website

## Josiah Janes, Digital Humanities 110, Professor Sookyung Cho, Fall 2021

Assignment Purpose: The purpose of this assignment is to critically examine the usability of various government websites. In this case, I will be evaluating the usability heuristics of Nevada's official Department of Motor Vehicles website as well as Nevada's Tax Center website. These 10 usability heuristics have been identified by Jakob Nielsen, otherwise known as the "king of usability" according to Internet Magazine. These heuristics are common usability issues that websites experience. By understanding where these websites fail and succeed in navigating user experience design, we can better understand how to make websites more accessible to all users.

#### Background Information

Nevada's Official Department of Motor Vehicles Website is used by citizens to obtain information about obtaining a driver's license, registering a vehicle, obtaining a license plate, and much more. While the DMV often requires citizens to come in to the department in person to fulfill their requests, there are some processes that take place entirely online, which makes the site's usability even more important.

Overall Evaluation: While this website is incredibly informative,

#### Background Information

Nevada's Official Tax Center Website is used by citizens to manage their business tax filings. Nearly all of this process is done online and warrants an exceptional user experience on behalf of the website to ensure that all users can file their taxes. This site is similar to the previous website I examined in the sense that both sites are used by citizens to navigate and comply with certain registration and taxation laws. With this in mind, it will be interesting to see how each site's user experience differs.

Overall Evaluation:
