# Assignment 01: Evaluation of Usability Heuristics on Nevada's Official Government Website

## Josiah Janes, Digital Humanities 110, Professor Sookyung Cho, Fall 2021

Assignment Purpose: The purpose of this assignment is to critically examine the usability of various government websites. In this case, I will be evaluating the usability heuristics of Nevada's official Department of Motor Vehicles website as well as Nevada's Tax Center website. These 10 usability heuristics have been identified by Jakob Nielsen, otherwise known as the "king of usability" according to Internet Magazine. These heuristics are common usability issues that make websites harder to use. By understanding where these websites fail and succeed in navigating user experience design, we can better understand how to make websites more accessible by all users.
