### Project Description
The purpose of this project is to create an interactive, high fidelity prototype of the Nevada DMV web app solution that I have been devising. By creating this prototype, I can finally give users the ability to navigate through the system solutions that I have devised. In doing so, I can get their feedback on those solutions as well as the site's overall layout and design. After conducting a cognitive walkthrough evaluation, I can then use the user's feedback and performance to revise the current design as well.

### Interactive Prototype
The interactive prototype can be found [here](https://www.figma.com/proto/84UnkGIfWpkQLEWP4fwWXy/Assignment-7-Interactive-Prototype---Josiah-Janes---105090684?node-id=2%3A59&scaling=min-zoom&page-id=0%3A1&starting-point-node-id=2%3A59).

The backend Figma project for this prototype can be found [here](https://www.figma.com/file/84UnkGIfWpkQLEWP4fwWXy/Assignment-7-Interactive-Prototype---Josiah-Janes---105090684?node-id=0%3A1).

### Tasks Supported by this Prototype

This prototype supports three main tasks including scheduling an appointment, renewing one's registration, and renewing one's driver license. These three tasks were chosen based on users' most commonly used services when navigating to the Nevada DMV website, and in theory, this web app would expedite these processes while alleviating traffic from the Nevada DMV website and its various physical locations.

### Summary of Findings and Process
The user was first tasked with scheduling an appointment at the DMV using this prototype. I encouraged them to play around with the prototype and click on anything they wanted. Interestingly, the first thing they clicked was to open the desktop version, so perhaps this user prefers to use the desktop version of sites as opposed to app solutions. After navigating away from that page, they tapped to continue to the app and quickly saw that they were able to schedule an appointment by tapping the "Schedule Appointment" button. They successfully chose a date and time for their appointment. They were a bit confused when they reached the input forms to submit their information, but I would simply attribute this to the fact that this prototype does not have the ability to input such information at this stage, so this can ignored for now. The user successfully completed this task and noted that it felt rather "self-explanatory", which is a positive.

I then asked the user if they felt lost at all throughout the task, and they said that they did not feel lost, and that it was "pretty well put together". I then encouraged the user to click through the rest of the prototype on their own as well as testing the submit button to see how they felt about progressing through the site. The user noted that they did feel like they were progressing through the app easily and that it was "really simple" and "self-explanatory". They did not that for the renew license section that I could add a page counter on the bottom of the screen so that the user can see how many pages they will need to fill out to complete their task, which I think is a fantastic idea.

I then asked the user about the labels, buttons, instructions, etc. to get their opinion on the layout. They talked about the pictures I chose and how they recommend that the picture I used for scheduling an appointment can be mistaken for a test, which I really agree with, and that it should be changed to something that is a bit more synonymous with scheduling an appointment. I think this is a great point. We concluded the test and the user seemed to feel pretty confident in their understanding of the app and believes that small revisions can be made to the prototype.

I really appreciated this user's feedback in this cognitive walkthrough. I believe things went fairly smoothly in terms of task completion, but what I really gathered is that there are some small things like page count and picture choice that could be revised to make for improvements to the app. Upon reviewing my previous grade for the last assignment, I also learned that there are some minute issues with my app's layout spacing in some areas, which I will also be sure to study and correct in future iterations. Overall, I believe that this high-fidelity prototype is a success and I look forward to incorporating all of the suggestions that have been provided to me to make for a better experience for the end user.
