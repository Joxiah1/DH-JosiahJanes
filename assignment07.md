### Description of Project
The purpose of this project is to create an interactive, high fidelity prototype of the Nevada DMV web app solution that I have been devising. By creating this prototype, I can finally give users the ability to navigate through the system solutions that I have devised. In doing so, I can get their feedback on those solutions as well as the site's overall layout and design. After conducting a cognitive walkthrough evaluation, I can then use the participant's feedback and performance to revise the current design as well.

#### Tasks Supported by this Prototype

This prototype supports three main tasks including scheduling an appointment, renewing one's registration, and renewing one's driver license. These three tasks were chosen based on users' most commonly used services when navigating to the Nevada DMV website, and in theory, this web app would expedite these processes while alleviating traffic from the Nevada DMV website and its various physical locations.
