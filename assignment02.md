# Assignment 02: Pilot UT of Nevada's Official DMV Website

## Josiah Janes, Digital Humanities 110, Professor Sookyung Cho, Fall 2021

### Assignment Purpose

According to Usability.Gov, "Usability testing refers to evaluating a product or service by testing it with representative users." Such testing is done to improve a product by identifying and iterating upon its weaknesses. In the case of this assignment, we will be evaluating the usability of Nevada's official DMV website (https://dmvnv.com/). In a previous assignment, we evaluated this website based on Jakob Nielsen's 10 Usability Heuristics and were able to identify some of this site's preliminary usability and design issues. While the site works fairly well already, it has some potential issues in the form of the site's lack of aesthetic coherence across it and its other third party systems, an infrequent use of images that serve to familiarize the user with the site and its purpose, and lackluster communication of clickable links via hover properties. As a result, we will be directly testing the usability of the site by asking a participant to complete several tasks. We will be measuring the participant's immediate and subsequent reaction to attempting these tasks to better understand where this site succeeds or fails in its usability design. In doing so, we can take our learnings from this evaluation and use them to design future websites with a heightened sense of usability in mind.

### Findings
After working with my participant, I learned a lot of valuable information about this site's usability issues as well as how the site can be improved. Also, my participant even made some suggestions about how to solve some of these issues. 

To begin with, my participant noted that they have some familiarity with websites similar to this one. Upon their first impression of the site, the participant noted that the site did not look easy nor hard to use. Surprisingly, my participant did not particularly trust the look of this website at first glance. They noted that due to the site's rather basic aesthetic and design, they believed that the sight could easily be a malicious fake. 

As described earlier, I crafted the usability evaluation to directly test some of this site's usability heuristics in a previous assignment. The first task tested whether the site's lack of aesthetic coherence across it and its third party systems would cause for usability issues. The task asked the participant to use the site's search bar to make an appointment. My participant was able to do so surprising quickly. However, they noted that they were confused when the site referred them to a separate web page to try to schedule their appointment, thus rendering my initial suspicions of usability issues of this type to be somewhat valid. With that being said, my participant was able to complete the task quickly and successfully. The participant noted that the first task was very easy, took as much time as expected, and that they are very likely to perform these tasks themself.

The second task tested how well the site could communicate its clickable links to users. The task asked the participant to use the site's upper navigation bar to find details about renewing their driver license. They were able to do so very easily, thus showing that the site may actually be communicating its links clickability quite well. However, my participant again remarked about how they were confused by the link they took to begin the online renewal process. While they were able to see the link, they believed that it could have been designed a bit better and as a button to better communicate its function. They also did not like how the button took them to a completely separate webpage, which is a further confirmation of the importance of integrating the site's third party systems into its own aesthetic and layout. The participant noted that the second task was very easy, took a bit longer than expected to complete, and that they are very likely to complete these tasks themself.

The last task tested how well the site's images functioned to communicate valuable information to the user. The participant was asked to find photos of various copies of driver licenses as well as information about obtaining a new one. Surprisingly, while there was a photo of one of these driver licenses on the front page of the website, the participant never registered its presence and had to find the photo by sorting through the site's various links. While they were able to complete the task fairly quickly by doing so, the site could greatly assist users by making the photos it uses larger and prominent. The particpant noted that the majority of the last task was very easy with the exception of finding a photo of the driver license, that the tasks took roughly the same time as they expected them to, and that it was fairly unlikely for them to complete these tasks themself.

Overall, the participant had rather mixed feelings about the website. While they felt that the website was not all too complex and was actually rather straightforward, they felt that various sections of the website were not very well integrated. In closing, the participant used various adjectives to describe the site and noted that the site was boring, cheap, old, unprofessional, yet familiar.

While some of my initial hypotheses about this site's potential usability issues were proven false in this test, most were proven correct. The participant confirmed that this site could greatly benefit from enlarging its images so they can be seen more easily and that the site could also benefit from integrating its third party systems more into the main site's overall layout and aesthetic. While the participant did not particularly like the site, they noted that the site works decently well. With these findings in mind, it is important to remind ourselves of the importance of a site's overall aesthetic and sizing when it comes to usability and accessibility.
