# Assignment 02: Pilot UT of Nevada's Official DMV Website

## Josiah Janes, Digital Humanities 110, Professor Sookyung Cho, Fall 2021

### Assignment Purpose

According to Usability.Gov, "Usability testing refers to evaluating a product or service by testing it with representative users." Such testing is done to improve a product by identifying and iterating upon its weaknesses. In the case of this assignment, we will be evaluating the usability of Nevada's official DMV website (https://dmvnv.com/). In a previous assignment, we evaluated this website based on Jakob Nielsen's 10 Usability Heuristics and were able to identify some of this site's preliminary usability and design issues. While the site works fairly well already, it has some potential issues in the form of the site's lack of aesthetic coherence across it and its other third party systems, an infrequent use of images that serve to familiarize the user with the site and its purpose, and lackluster communication of clickable links via hover properties. As a result, we will be directly testing the usability of the site by asking a participant to complete several tasks. We will be measuring the participant's immediate reaction to attempting these tasks and will subsequently record the participant's opinion on the overall usability of the site as well to better understand where this site succeeds or fails in its usability design. In doing so, we can take our learnings from this evaluation and use them to design future websites with a heightened sense of usability in mind.
