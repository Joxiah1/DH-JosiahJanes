# Creating an Application Solution for Nevada's DMV
## Josiah Janes, Digital Humanities 110, Professor Sookyung Cho, Fall 2021

### Introduction
The goal of this project was to create an application for users to easily interact with the Nevada DMV's most used services. The application includes functionality for scheduling an in-person appointment at the DMV, renewing one's registration, and renewing one's license. Both young and elderly people often use these services, so the application was designed to be as simple and user friendly as possible. According to some of the responses that have been received about the application's functionality and design, it seems that the application can be easily used by all users to complete these tasks.

### Design Statement
When I talked with people about their opinions on their states' respective DMV's, they all mentioned that they anticipate feeling lost and confused when using their DMV's website. Through this UX project, I hoped to solve this issue by using the application I designed to alleviate stress and confusion on behalf of the user and to expedite some of the most commonly used DMV services.

### Competitor Analysis
To begin the project, I started by critically examining the usability of various government websites including the original website for the Nevada DMV. I used Jakob Nielsen's 10 usability heuristics guideline to make this evaluation and learned alot about where these types of websites both succeed and fail in meeting users' functionality needs and aesthetic preferences.

### Usability Testing
Using the original Nevada DMV website, I then conducted usability testing to understand how users interact with and understand the site. The previous heuristic evaluation helped me to identify issues with aesthetic coherence across the site and its third party systems as well as how the site's images are displayed. By asking a participant to complete some simple tasks such as renewing their driver license, I was able to see that there were additional issues with the site's original design. The participant thought the original site appeared to be easy to use at a glance, but that actually completing the tasks assigned to them was rather difficult and confusing. The participant also noted that the site looks rather bare and even untrustworthy in some aspects. [Read more...](https://github.com/Joxiah1/DH110-JosiahJanes/blob/main/assignment02.md)

### User Research
I then conducted an additional test to examine the common problems that users encounter while using the website to register a vehicle with their respective DMV. This research also involved a hypothesis of the site's target userbase. While the site is used by all ages, this activity focused on how young adults (18-30) interact with the site and what can be redesigned to better suit their needs. From this research, the participant's interaction with the site helped to identify that users of this type prefer web pages that are simple, streamlined, guiding, and official in the way that they present and ask the user for information regarding vehicle registration.

### UX Storytelling
To take my user research process a step further, I developed several personas and empathy maps to better hypothesize and analyze this application's common userbase. As mentioned earlier, this can be somewhat of a challenge because the Nevada DMV is used by people of all ages and occupations. With this in mind, I developed three different personas ranging from a high school student to a retired adult. By understanding how these users think, what they value, and what they fear, I was better able to understand how to develop my application to better suit the needs of all people.

### Low-Fidelity Prototyping
In the beginning of my application's design, I created a low-fidelity prototype of the envisioned application solution. As identified in previous analyses of users' most used services on DMV websites of this type, I decided to include functionality for appointment scheduling, vehicle registration renewal, and driver license renewal. I also added an additional wireflow overlay to the prototype diagram to demonstrate how I felt the application should progress as the user interacted with it. To make users feel less confused and more trusting of the application, I removed much of the bulk of the original site, made the tasks simple and easy to complete, and added several confirmation screens to make users feel that they were completing their tasks successfully. At the same time, I also provided users with the option to use the original website at the starting page of the application. This rough outline helped me to properly envision my project and look upon it critically upon completion. [Read more...](https://github.com/Joxiah1/DH110-JosiahJanes/blob/main/assignment05.md)

### Graphic and Interface Design
I then made a second design pass through my initial prototype's layout with an added emphasis on commonly accepted color contrast ratios and spacing requirements. This additional polishing phase allowed me to better understand how to incorporate the original site's color scheme into the application's own colors and design while maintaining proper color contrast ratios. I also devised several different options for font families, sizing, and even additional themes for users that may prefer alternative color schemes.

### High-fidelity Prototyping 
The final step of the project involved the finalization of the previously devised layout and color scheme as well as tying all of the wireframes together to create a truly interactive high fidelity prototype. The best part of creating this interactive prototype was the ability to give the prototype to users to truly understand and watch how they interact with it in real time. This allowed me to troubleshoot some of my own design choices as well as the application's layout to better meet the needs of the user. According to the high fidelity prototype testing that I conducted, the application was successful in simplifying many of the tasks that users previously had trouble completing with the original website's design.

### Conclusion
Overall, the application seems to be a success. According to users, the application is simple, easy to use, and aesthetically appealing. At the same time, there is so much more than can be added to this application, whether that be additional info, tasks, etc., and hopefully, websites like that of the Nevada DMV will implement app-based solutions such as this one to better meet users' needs in the future.

In terms of the actual process of completing this project, I learned so much about what goes into designing a prototype such as this one. Learning about how to use interface design apps like Figma was incredibly enjoyable and informative, and now I finally understand how these types of applications are designed from the ground up. Going into the project, I did not realize how important it is to study and understand the target userbase and how they interact with the product. While observing the way in which they interact with the product is incredibly valuable for feedback, I underestimated the tremendous impact that persona and empathy maps can have on design choices.

Most importantly, this project taught me how to break large projects into smaller tasks. While the prospect of designing a new and improved interactive application can be incredibly daunting, breaking any task into smaller segments can help to lessen the stress of completing any goal. I cannot wait to use my newfound skills to assist me in future projects as well as life as a whole.
