# Creating an Application Solution for Nevada's DMV
## Josiah Janes

### Introuction
The goal of this project was to create an application for users to easily interact with the Nevada DMV's most used services. The application includes functionality for scheduling an in-person appointment at the DMV, renewing one's registration, and renewing one's license. Both young and elderly people often use these services, so the application was designed to be as simple and user friendly as possible. According to some of the responses that have been received about the applications functionality and design, it seems that the application can be easily used by all users to complete these tasks.

### Design Statement
What is the issue and why do you think it is important to resolve that issue by your project?\
When I talked with people about their opinions on their states' respective DMV's, they all mentioned that they anticipate feeling lost and confused when using their DMV's website. Through this UX project, I hope to solve this issue by using the application I designed to alleviate stress and confusion on behalf of the user and to expedite some of the most commonly used DMV services.
