### The Purpose of This Project and Low-Fidelity Prototyping as a Whole
This project examines the potential solutions that could be used to solve the common issues that our intended userbase encounters while using Nevada's online DMV resources. Previous projects have studied and determined the personalities and needs of our userbase and we have even identified the specific problems that our users have when using Nevada's official DMV website. 

It has been concluded that the common userbase wants a smartphone application that they can use to satisfy all of their DMV needs. While the app ought to include access to all of the original website's information, this low-fidelity prototype focuses exclusively on making appointment scheduling, vehicle registration renewal, and driver license renewal as easy as possible. Since these are the primary and most used functions of the DMV website according to our users, these tasks have been chosen to test the prototype. Our users have abundantly indicated that they would prefer an application with a simple and direct layout, guiding links and submission forms, and an overall trustworthy and official feel.

More information about user personas and task scenarios can be found [here](https://github.com/Joxiah1/DH110-JosiahJanes/blob/main/assignment04.md).

### Tasks Supported in this Prototype
As mentioned earlier, this prototype was specifically designed to more quickly connect users with what we believe to be the Nevada DMV's three most commonly used functions: appointment scheduling, vehicle registration renewal, and driver license renewal. As shown in the prototype layout below, users can pick between these tasks at a very early stage in the demonstration. From their initial choices, the application guides users through a straightforward and step by step process to complete their desired task.

### Prototype Testing

A random participant was asked to test this prototype, and the recording can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1R2ghQfgjshgRrIpR4C25AqYyZQfeXty2/view?usp=sharing).

Task 1: Schedule an Appointment
>At the beginning stage of the test, the participant had to navigate forward from the main page that asks users to pick between the app and desktop version of the site. The participant noted the text between the options and opted to continue with the app because it "can be used to quickly navigate to [the] most used DMV services." Once reaching the home page, the participant quickly selected "Schedule Appointment". They then navigated to the calendar to choose the date of their appointment and they effectively understood that options marked in green were available. Because Friday the 13th was the only available option, they chose it. They quickly chose their time slot, 10 AM to 11 AM, under the same guiding principles. At this point, they noted that the prototype was "definitely very user friendly so far". Once taken to the page to input their identification information, they typed their information in and promptly clicked submit. They successfully completed the task of scheduling an appointment.

Task 2: Renew Registration
>The participant was then tasked with renewing their vehicle registration. From the previous appointment scheduling confirmation screen, they tapped "Return to Home Page". They then quickly clicked on "Renew Registration". They then entered their required information, and then promptly pressed submit. They successfully completed the task of renewing their vehicle registration without any issues.

Task 3: Renew Driver License
>The participant was then tasked with renewing their driver license. From the previous registration renewal screen, they tapped "Return to Home Page". They promptly clicked on "Renew License". They then quickly entered in their information and pressed submit. Upon receiving a notification that they were eligible to complete their registration, the participant then entered in their remaining pin number and credit card information and pressed submit without issue. It shall be noted, however, that the participant saw the label "PIN Number (Sent through Mail)" and thought that the pin would be sent to them through email. This is not necessarily the case, normally PINs are sent through paper mail. They then submitted their information. They successfully completed the task of renewing their driver license.

### Reflection
In reflection, I believe the prototype did a fantastic job of solving users' three most common needs when using Nevada's DMV website. As the participant noted, the app felt "definitely very user friendly" and they had no issues completing the tasks. The participant also seemed to become increasingly familiar with the prototype and its layout as the test continued, which is also a positive sign.

When asked about what could have been done better, the participant felt that the prototype was actually designed well in its current from. When asked about what other services they commonly use at the DMV that could be incorporated in this prototype, the participant said that maybe a section could be added for submitting insurance claims.

While I am pleased with the prototype, it only scratches the surface of the other services that this smartphone app solution should require in the product's final form. While the app benefits from being straight forward in its ability to help users to complete common tasks, it is lacking in the sense that it is not a good source of raw information. With that being said, if users want to consult with such information, they can simply navigate to the Nevada DMV website from the front page of the prototype and go from there.
