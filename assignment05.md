### The Purpose of This Project and Low-Fidelity Prototyping as a Whole
This project examines the potential solutions that could be used to solve the common issues that our intended userbase encounters while using Nevada's online DMV resources. Previous projects have studied and determined the personalities and needs of our userbase and we have even identified the specific problems that our users have when using Nevada's official DMV website. 

It has been concluded that the common userbase wants a smartphone application that they can use to satisfy all of their DMV needs. While the app ought to include access to all of the original website's information, this low-fidelity prototype focuses exclusively on making appointment scheduling, vehicle registration renewal, and driver license renewal as easy as possible. Since these are the primary and most used functions of the DMV website according to our users, these tasks have been chosen to test the prototype. Our users have abundantly indicated that they would prefer an application with a simple and direct layout, guiding links and submission forms, and an overall trustworthy and official feel.

More information about user personas and task scenarios can be found [here](https://github.com/Joxiah1/DH110-JosiahJanes/blob/main/assignment04.md).

### Tasks Supported in this Prototype
As mentioned earlier, this prototype was specifically designed to more quickly connect users with what we believe to be the Nevada DMV's three most commonly used functions: appointment scheduling, vehicle registration renewal, and driver license renewal. As shown in the prototype layout below, users can pick between these tasks at a very early stage in the demonstration. From their initial choices, the application guides users through a straightforward and step by step process to complete their desired task.
